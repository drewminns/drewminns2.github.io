Use of Frameworks or Templates
=========
I highly discourage the use of 3rd-party templates, frameworks and any plagiarism of code from external sources. Only when included in a lesson or strictly stated and required in an assignment or exercise, will these be accepted. I've been doing this for awhile, I'll knowâ€¦

Assignments
===========
__Approach Every assignment like it is a real project, for a real client__.

Remove any unused code or files. Submit only what is needed.

Be sure to review your code and validate to ensure code is the best it can be!

Use appropriate naming conventions for your files, page titles and elements.

Submitting Assignments
===========
Assignments can be shared through either Dropbox or GitHub. Please provide a link to your assignment through email to [dminns@gmail.com](mailto:dminns@gmail.com) with all required files.

Submitting assignments early does not earn a better grade. Review often.
